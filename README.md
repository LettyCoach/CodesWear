## ðŸš§ Project Structure Note

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Just a heads up that this project was built around 8 months ago as part of my learning journey with Next.js. At that time, I was still getting the hang of best practices and optimal folder structures. As a result, you might find that the project structure isn't as polished as it could be.
